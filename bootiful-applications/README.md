# Bootiful Applications with Spring Boot

## Intro
In this section we'll look at using Spring Boot to make short work of building individual applications and services.

- we'll look at how easily Spring Boot can talk to a backend database
- we'll look at Spring Boot's support for building web applications and REST services
- we'll look at how to monitor and make production-ready a service using Spring Boot Actuator

## Running the Example
This example uses H2 and so should run locally. Use `mvn spring-boot:run` for the `demo` module or simply run the application in your IDE using `public static void main`.
